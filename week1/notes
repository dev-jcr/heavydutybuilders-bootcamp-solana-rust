Programming model in Solana

Accounts
  function 
    Store the state (data, from programs to token balance).
  types  
    Executable
      store 
        user programs
        native programs
    Non-Executable
      store
        data
          like context data.
  Structure
    Address
      Public key
        identifier
    AccountInfo
      lamports
        number of lamports define the account balance.
      owner
        program owner
          it can
            modify and debit account
      executable
        indicates if executable or not
      data
        array of account data bytes
      rent_epoch
        the next epoch that the account will owe rent
  other characteristics
    they only store code, not data
    they pay rent proportional to the occupied space (10 MB max)

programs
  account with executable code
    smart contracts  == programs
    have no state
    data is stored in separated data accounts
  types
    native
      system program
        property of system program until it's seeded
      BPF Loader
        non-native programs owner
  structure        
    address
      public key (program ID)
    AccountInfo
      data
      owner: BPF Loader
      executable: true
      lamports
    AccountData
      program code

Transactions
  are a
    set of instructions
      that
        interact with various programs in the network
        processed in order of added
  have
    atomicity
      all instructions must be processed correctly to succeeed
    max size 
      of 1232 bytes
  structure
    transaction
      instruction
        program_id
        accounts
          AccountMeta
            pubkey
            is_signer
            is_writable
          AccountMeta
            pubkey
            is_signer
            is_writable
        data

instructions
  logical unit 
    that
     execute
      implementing changes
  structure
    program_id
      address of program to be invoqued
    accounts
      accounts list necessary for execution
    data
      serialized code about actions to be done

practical class
  see my first project for basic structure with comments.
